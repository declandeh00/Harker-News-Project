Here is the URL link to my application on Vercel:

## How do you set up the environment, i.e., after the repository is cloned, what do you need to do before you run the application?

## How do you run your application locally?
To run my application locally, you will need to execute the command `npm run dev` in the terminal, which will create a link called localhost:3000.

## How do you run your component tests?
To run my component tests, you will need to execute the command `npm run test` in the terminal, which will run my 15 tests.

## How do you lint and fix your code?
To run ESLint (lint) on my code, you will need to execute the command `npm run lint:check` in the terminal, and to fix the code, you will need to run the command `npm run lint:check --fix` in the terminal or go to the file and find the line where the error is and manually fix it.

## How do you format your code?
When formatting my code, I use Prettier. To format my code, I follow these steps:
